thank you lester our jobs are fleeing the country theyre going to mexico theyre going to many other countries you look at what china is doing to our country in terms of making our product theyre devaluing their currency and theres nobody in our government to fight them and we have a very good fight and we have a winning fight because theyre using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild china and many other countries are doing the same thingso were losing our good jobs so many of them when you look at whats happening in mexico a friend of mine who builds plants said its the eighth wonder of the world theyre building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world some of the most sophisticated some of the best plants with the united states as he said not so muchso ford is leaving you see that their small car division leaving thousands of jobs leaving michigan leaving ohio theyre all leaving and we cant allow it to happen anymore as far as child care is concerned and so many other things i think hillary and i agree on that we probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what were going to do but perhaps well be talking about that laterbut we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us we have to stop our companies from leaving the united states and with it firing all of their people all you have to do is take a look at carrier air conditioning in indianapolis they left  fired 1400 people theyre going to mexico so many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this we cannot let it happen under my plan ill be reducing taxes tremendously from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies small and big businesses thats going to be a job creator like we havent seen since ronald reagan its going to be a beautiful thing to watchcompanies will come they will build they will expand new companies will start and i look very very much forward to doing it we have to renegotiate our trade deals and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs well for one thing  and before we start on that  my father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and i built it into a company thats worth many many billions of dollars with some of the greatest assets in the world and i say that only because thats the kind of thinking that our country needsour countrys in deep trouble we dont know what were doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world especially china theyre the best the best ever at it what theyre doing to us is a very very sad thingso we have to do that we have to renegotiate our trade deals and lester theyre taking our jobs theyre giving incentives theyre doing things that frankly we dont dolet me give you the example of mexico they have a vat tax were on a different system when we sell into mexico theres a tax when they sell in  automatic 16 percent approximately when they sell into us theres no tax its a defective agreement its been defective for a long time many years but the politicians havent done anything about itnow in all fairness to secretary clinton  yes is that ok good i want you to be very happy its very important to mebut in all fairness to secretary clinton when she started talking about this it was really very recently shes been doing this for 30 years and why hasnt she made the agreements better the nafta agreement is defective just because of the tax and many other reasons but just because of the fact secretary clinton and others politicians should have been doing this for years not right now because of the fact that weve created a movement they should have been doing this for years whats happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is  look we owe 20 trillion we cannot do it any longer lester  well the first thing you do is dont let the jobs leave the companies are leaving i could name i mean there are thousands of them theyre leaving and theyre leaving in bigger numbers than everand what you do is you say fine you want to go to mexico or some other country good luck we wish you a lot of luck but if you think youre going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax youre wrongand once you say youre going to have to tax them coming in and our politicians never do this because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave because in many cases they own the companies so what im saying is we can stop them from leaving we have to stop them from leaving and thats a big big factor thats called business by the way i did not i did not i do not say that i do not say that she talks about solar panels we invested in a solar company our country that was a disaster they lost plenty of money on that onenow look im a great believer in all forms of energy but were putting a lot of people out of work our energy policies are a disaster our country is losing so much in terms of energy in terms of paying off our debt you cant do what youre looking to do with 20 trillion in debtthe obama administration from the time theyve come in is over 230 years worth of debt and hes topped it hes doubled it in a course of almost eight years sevenandahalf years to be semi exactso i will tell you this we have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs and we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand because theyre not doing itand all you have to do is look at michigan and look at ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving theyre goneand hillary id just ask you this youve been doing this for 30 years why are you just thinking about these solutions right now for 30 years youve been doing it and now youre just starting to think of solutions i will bring  excuse me i will bring back jobs you cant bring back jobs yeah for 30 years well he approved nafta he approved nafta which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country but you havent done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to you havent done it you havent done it excuse me your husband signed nafta which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry you go to new england you go to ohio pennsylvania you go anywhere you want secretary clinton and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30 40 sometimes 50 percent nafta is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere but certainly ever signed in this countryand now you want to approve transpacific partnership you were totally in favor of it then you heard what i was saying how bad it is and you said i cant win that debate but you know that if you did win you would approve that and that will be almost as bad as nafta nothing will ever top nafta you called it the gold standard you called it the gold standard of trade deals you said its the finest deal youve ever seen and then you heard what i said about it and all of a sudden you were against it not so is it president obamas fault is it president obamas fault secretary is it president obamas fault because hes pushing it but you have no plan secretary you have no plan thats about all youve you are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history you are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history you are going to drive business out your regulations are a disaster and youre going to increase regulations all over the placeand by the way my tax cut is the biggest since ronald reagan im very proud of it it will create tremendous numbers of new jobs but regulations you are going to regulate these businesses out of existencewhen i go around  lester i tell you this ive been all over and when i go around despite the tax cut the thing  the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that im cutting regulation you have regulations on top of regulations and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business and you want to increase the regulations and make them even worseim going to cut regulations im going to cut taxes big league and youre going to raise taxes big league end of story facts and take a look at mine also and youll see well could i just finish  i think i i think i should  you go to her website and you take a look at her website shes going to raise taxes 13 trillion and look at her website you know what its no difference than this shes telling us how to fight isis just go to her website she tells you how to fight isis on her website i dont think general douglas macarthur would like that too much no no youre telling the enemy everything you want to do see youre telling the enemy everything you want to do no wonder youve been fighting  no wonder youve been fighting isis your entire adult life well im really calling for major jobs because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs theyre going to expand their companies theyre going to do a tremendous jobim getting rid of the carried interest provision and if you really look its not a tax  its really not a great thing for the wealthy its a great thing for the middle class its a great thing for companies to expandand when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies and when theyre going to bring 25 trillion back from overseas where they cant bring the money back because politicians like secretary clinton wont allow them to bring the money back because the taxes are so onerous and the bureaucratic red tape so what  is so badso what theyre doing is theyre leaving our country and theyre believe it or not leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country and instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work because they cant work out a deal to  and everybody agrees it should be brought backinstead of that theyre leaving our country to get their money because they cant bring their money back into our country because of bureaucratic red tape because they cant get together because we have  we have a president that cant sit them around a table and get them to approve somethingand heres the thing republicans and democrats agree that this should be done 25 trillion i happen to think its double that its probably 5 trillion that we cant bring into our country lester and with a little leadership youd get it in here very quickly and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things and it would be beautifulbut we have no leadership and honestly that starts with secretary clinton why not theres nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country yes then you didnt read it who gave it that name the first ive  who gave it that name how much how much for my family  lester how much typical politician all talk no action sounds good doesnt work never going to happen our country is suffering because people like secretary clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of whats going onnow look we have the worst revival of an economy since the great depression and believe me were in a bubble right now and the only thing that looks good is the stock market but if you raise interest rates even a little bit thats going to come crashing downwe are in a big fat ugly bubble and we better be awfully careful and we have a fed thats doing political things this janet yellen of the fed the fed is doing political  by keeping the interest rates at this level and believe me the day obama goes off and he leaves and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf when they raise interest rates youre going to see some very bad things happen because the fed is not doing their job the fed is being more political than secretary clinton i dont mind releasing  im under a routine audit and itll be released and  as soon as the audits finished it will be releasedbut you will learn more about donald trump by going down to the federal elections where i filed a 104page essentially financial statement of sorts the forms that they have it shows income  in fact the income  i just looked today  the income is filed at 694 million for this past year 694 million if you would have told me i was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago i would have been very surprisedbut thats the kind of thinking that our country needs when we have a country thats doing so badly thats being ripped off by every single country in the world its the kind of thinking that our country needs because everybody  lester we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with of almost 800 billion a year you know what that is that means whos negotiating these trade dealswe have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals excuse me well i told you i will release them as soon as the audit look ive been under audit almost for 15 years i know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited i said do you get audited i get audited almost every yearand in a way i should be complaining im not even complaining i dont mind it its almost become a way of life i get audited by the irs but other people donti will say this we have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of i will release my tax returns  against my lawyers wishes  when she releases her 33000 emails that have been deleted as soon as she releases them i will releasei will release my tax returns and thats against  my lawyers they say dont do it i will tell you this no  in fact watching shows theyre reading the papers almost every lawyer says you dont release your returns until the audits complete when the audits complete ill do it but i would go against them if she releases her emails its not negotiable no let her release the emails why did she delete 33000 that makes me smart thats for sure that was more than a mistake that was done purposely ok that was not a mistake that was done purposely when you have your staff taking the fifth amendment taking the fifth so theyre not prosecuted when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the fifth i think its disgraceful and believe me this country thinks its  really thinks its disgraceful alsoas far as my tax returns you dont learn that much from tax returns that i can tell you you learn a lot from financial disclosure and you should go down and take a look at thatthe other thing im extremely underleveraged the report that said 650  which by the way a lot of friends of mine that know my business say boy thats really not a lot of money its not a lot of money relative to what i hadthe buildings that were in question they said in the same report which was  actually it wasnt even a bad story to be honest with you but the buildings are worth 39 billion and the 650 isnt even on that but its not 650 its much less than thatbut i could give you a list of banks i would  if that would help you i would give you a list of banks these are very fine institutions very fine banks i could do that very quicklyi am very underleveraged i have a great company i have a tremendous income and the reason i say that is not in a braggadocios way its because its about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about moneywhen we have 20 trillion in debt and our countrys a mess you know its one thing to have 20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everythings in great shape our airports our airports are like from a third world countryyou land at laguardia you land at kennedy you land at lax you land at newark and you come in from dubai and qatar and you see these incredible  you come in from china you see these incredible airports and you land  weve become a third world countryso the worst of all things has happened we owe 20 trillion and were a mess we havent even started and weve spent 6 trillion in the middle east according to a report that i just saw whether its 6 or 5 but it looks like its 6 6 trillion in the middle east we could have rebuilt our country twiceand its really a shame and its politicians like secretary clinton that have caused this problem our country has tremendous problems were a debtor nation were a serious debtor nation and we have a country that needs new roads new tunnels new bridges new airports new schools new hospitals and we dont have the money because its been squandered on so many of your ideas it would be squandered too believe me maybe he didnt do a good job and i was unsatisfied with his work which our country should do too wrong wrong so yeah i think  i do think its time look its all words its all sound bites i built an unbelievable company some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world real estate assets anywhere in the world beyond the united states in europe lots of different places its an unbelievable companybut on occasion four times we used certain laws that are there and when secretary clinton talks about people that didnt get paid first of all they did get paid a lot but taken advantage of the laws of the nationnow if you want to change the laws youve been there a long time change the laws but i take advantage of the laws of the nation because im running a company my obligation right now is to do well for myself my family my employees for my companies and thats what i dobut what she doesnt say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me ill give you an example were just opening up on pennsylvania avenue right next to the white house so if i dont get there one way im going to get to pennsylvania avenue anotherbut were opening the old post office under budget ahead of schedule saved tremendous money im a year ahead of schedule and thats what this country should be doingwe build roads and they cost two and three and four times what theyre supposed to cost we buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be because we dont have people that know what theyre doingwhen we look at the budget the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy the trump international is way under budget and way ahead of schedule and we should be able to do that for our country well first of all secretary clinton doesnt want to use a couple of words and thats law and order and we need law and order if we dont have it were not going to have a countryand when i look at whats going on in charlotte a city i love a city where i have investments when i look at whats going on throughout various parts of our country whether its  i mean i can just keep naming them all day long  we need law and order in our countryi just got today the as you know the endorsement of the fraternal order of police we just  just came in we have endorsements from i think almost every police group very  i mean a large percentage of them in the united stateswe have a situation where we have our inner cities african americans hispanics are living in hell because its so dangerous you walk down the street you get shotin chicago theyve had thousands of shootings thousands since january 1st thousands of shootings and im saying where is this is this a wartorn country what are we doing and we have to stop the violence we have to bring back law and order in a place like chicago where thousands of people have been killed thousands over the last number of years in fact almost 4000 have been killed since barack obama became president over  almost 4000 people in chicago have been killed we have to bring back law and ordernow whether or not in a place like chicago you do stop and frisk which worked very well mayor giuliani is here worked very well in new york it brought the crime rate way down but you take the gun away from criminals that shouldnt be having itwe have gangs roaming the street and in many cases theyre illegally here illegal immigrants and they have guns and they shoot people and we have to be very strong and we have to be very vigilantwe have to be  we have to know what were doing right now our police in many cases are afraid to do anything we have to protect our inner cities because africanamerican communities are being decimated by crime decimated no youre wrong it went before a judge who was a very againstpolice judge it was taken away from her and our mayor our new mayor refused to go forward with the case they would have won an appeal if you look at it throughout the country there are many places where its allowed no the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldnt have themthese are felons these are people that are bad people that shouldnt be  when you have 3000 shootings in chicago from january 1st when you have 4000 people killed in chicago by guns from the beginning of the presidency of barack obama his hometown you have to have stopandfriskyou need more police you need a better community you know relation you dont have good community relations in chicago its terrible i have property there its terrible whats going on in chicagobut when you look  and chicagos not the only  you go to ferguson you go to so many different places you need better relationships i agree with secretary clinton on this you need better relationships between the communities and the police because in some cases its not goodbut you look at dallas where the relationships were really studied the relationships were really a beautiful thing and then five police officers were killed one night very violently so theres some bad things going on some really bad things but we need  lester we need law and order and we need law and order in the inner cities because the people that are most affected by whats happening are africanamerican and hispanic people and its very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen ugh id like to respond to that first of all i agree and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no fly lists i agree with you when a person is on a watch list or a nofly list and i have the endorsement of the nra which im very proud of these are very very good people and theyre protecting the second amendmentbut i think we have to look very strongly at nofly lists and watch lists and when people are on there even if they shouldnt be on there well help them well help them legally well help them get off but i tend to agree with that quite stronglyi do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words superpredator about young black youth and thats a term that i think was a  its  its been horribly met as you know i think youve apologized for it but i think it was a terrible thing to sayand when it comes to stopandfrisk you know youre talking about takes guns away well im talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them and i dont think  i really dont think you disagree with me on this if you want to know the truthi think maybe theres a political reason why you cant say it but i really dont believe  in new york city stopandfrisk we had 2200 murders and stopandfrisk brought it down to 500 murders five hundred murders is a lot of murders its hard to believe 500 is like supposed to be goodbut we went from 2200 to 500 and it was continued on by mayor bloomberg and it was terminated by current mayor but stopand frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of new york city tremendous beyond belief so when you say it has no impact it really did it had a very very big impact no youre wrong youre wrong murders are up all right you check it id like to just respond if i might id just like to respond i will look the africanamerican community has been let down by our politicians they talk good around election time like right now and after the election they said see ya later ill see you in four yearsthe africanamerican community  because  look the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated theyve been abused and used in order to get votes by democrat politicians because thats what it is theyve controlled these communities for up to 100 years and i will tell you you look at the inner cities  and i just left detroit and i just left philadelphia and i just  you know youve seen me ive been all over the place you decided to stay home and thats ok but i will tell you ive been all over and ive met some of the greatest people ill ever meet within these communities and they are very very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done ill tell you very  well just very simple to say sidney blumenthal works for the campaign and close  very close friend of secretary clinton and her campaign manager patti doyle went to  during the campaign her campaign against president obama fought very hard and you can go look it up and you can check it out and if you look at cnn this past week patti solis doyle was on wolf blitzer saying that this happened blumenthal sent mcclatchy highly respected reporter at mcclatchy to kenya to find out about it they were pressing it very hard she failed to get the birth certificatewhen i got involved i didnt fail i got him to give the birth certificate so im satisfied with it and ill tell you why im satisfied with it because i want to get on to defeating isis because i want to get on to creating jobs because i want to get on to having a strong border because i want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country yeah well nobody was pressing it nobody was caring much about it i figured youd ask the question tonight of course but nobody was caring much about it but i was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate and i think i did a good jobsecretary clinton also fought it i mean you know  now everybody in mainstream is going to say oh thats not true look its true sidney blumenthal sent a reporter  you just have to take a look at cnn the last week the interview with your former campaign manager and she was involved but just like she cant bring back jobs she cant produce well it was very  i say nothing i say nothing because i was able to get him to produce it he should have produced it a long time before i say nothingbut let me just tell you when you talk about healing i think that ive developed very very good relationships over the last little while with the africanamerican community i think you can see thatand i feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion and i think i did a great job and a great service not only for the country but even for the president in getting him to produce his birth certificate i would love to respond first of all i got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against barack obama you treated him with terrible disrespect and i watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are it doesnt work that way you were after him you were trying to  you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb very famous pictures i dont think you can deny thatbut just last week your campaign manager said it was true so when you tried to act holier than thou it really doesnt work it really doesntnow as far as the lawsuit yes when i was very young i went into my fathers company had a real estate company in brooklyn and queens and we along with many many other companies throughout the country  it was a federal lawsuit  were sued we settled the suit with zero  with no admission of guilt it was very easy to do i notice you bring that up a lot and you know i also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways which i dont do on you maybe im trying to save the moneybut frankly i look  i look at that and i say isnt that amazing because i settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms and its just one of those thingsill go one step further in palm beach florida tough community a brilliant community a wealthy community probably the wealthiest community there is in the world i opened a club and really got great credit for it no discrimination against african americans against muslims against anybody and its a tremendously successful club and im so glad i did it and i have been given great credit for what i did and im very very proud of it and thats the way i feel that is the true way i feel i do want to say that i was just endorsed  and more are coming next week  it will be over 200 admirals many of them here  admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country that just happened and many more are coming and im very proud of itin addition i was just endorsed by ice theyve never endorsed anybody before on immigration i was just endorsed by ice i was just recently endorsed  16500 border patrol agentsso when secretary clinton talks about this i mean ill take the admirals and ill take the generals any day over the political hacks that i see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge ok because look at the mess that were in look at the mess that were inas far as the cyber i agree to parts of what secretary clinton said we should be better than anybody else and perhaps were not i dont think anybody knows it was russia that broke into the dnc shes saying russia russia russia but i dont  maybe it was i mean it could be russia but it could also be china it could also be lots of other people it also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds ok you dont know who broke in to dncbut what did we learn with dnc we learned that bernie sanders was taken advantage of by your people by debbie wasserman schultz look what happened to her but bernie sanders was taken advantage of thats what we learnednow whether that was russia whether that was china whether it was another country we dont know because the truth is under president obama weve lost control of things that we used to have control overwe came in with the internet we came up with the internet and i think secretary clinton and myself would agree very much when you look at what isis is doing with the internet theyre beating us at our own game isisso we have to get very very tough on cyber and cyber warfare it is  it is a huge problem i have a son hes 10 years old he has computers he is so good with these computers its unbelievable the security aspect of cyber is very very tough and maybe its hardly doablebut i will say we are not doing the job we should be doing but thats true throughout our whole governmental society we have so many things that we have to do better lester and certainly cyber is one of them well first i have to say one thing very important secretary clinton is talking about taking out isis we will take out isis well president obama and secretary clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of iraq because they got out  what they shouldnt have been in but once they got in the way they got out was a disaster and isis was formedso she talks about taking them out shes been doing it a long time shes been trying to take them out for a long time but they wouldnt have even been formed if they left some troops behind like 10000 or maybe something more than that and then you wouldnt have had themor as ive been saying for a long time and i think youll agree because i said it to you once had we taken the oil  and we should have taken the oil  isis would not have been able to form either because the oil was their primary source of income and now they have the oil all over the place including the oil  a lot of the oil in libya which was another one of her disasters wrong wrong wrong well i have to respond the secretary said very strongly about working with  weve been working with them for many years and we have the greatest mess anyones ever seen you look at the middle east its a total mess under your direction to a large extentbut you look at the middle east you started the iran deal thats another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall i mean they were doing so badly they were choking on the sanctions and now theyre going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon the way theyre goingbut when you look at nato i was asked on a major show what do you think of nato and you have to understand im a businessperson i did really well but i have common sense and i said well ill tell you i havent given lots of thought to nato but two thingsnumber one the 28 countries of nato many of them arent paying their fair share number two  and that bothers me because we should be asking  were defending them and they should at least be paying us what theyre supposed to be paying by treaty and contractand number two i said and very strongly nato could be obsolete because  and i was very strong on this and it was actually covered very accurately in the new york times which is unusual for the new york times to be honest  but i said they do not focus on terror and i was very strong and i said it numerous timesand about four months ago i read on the front page of the wall street journal that nato is opening up a major terror division and i think thats great and i think we should get  because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of nato its a lot of money to protect other people but im all for nato but i said they have to focus on terror alsoand theyre going to do that and that was  believe me  im sure im not going to get credit for it  but that was largely because of what i was saying and my criticism of natoi think we have to get nato to go into the middle east with us in addition to surrounding nations and we have to knock the hell out of isis and we have to do it fast when isis formed in this vacuum created by barack obama and secretary clinton and believe me you were the ones that took out the troops not only that you named the day they couldnt believe it they sat back probably and said i cant believe it they said no wait a minute when they formed when they formed this is something that never should have happened it should have never happened now youre talking about taking out isis but you were there and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant now its in over 30 countries and youre going to stop them i dont think so i did not support the war in iraq that is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her because she  frankly i think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media just  would you like to hear wait a minute i was against the war in iraq just so you put it out the record does not show that the record shows that im right when i did an interview with howard stern very lightly first time anyones asked me that i said very lightly i dont know maybe who knows essentially i then did an interview with neil cavuto we talked about the economy is more important i then spoke to sean hannity which everybody refuses to call sean hannity i had numerous conversations with sean hannity at fox and sean hannity said  and he called me the other day  and i spoke to him about it  he said you were totally against the war because he was for the war and when he  excuse me and that was before the war started sean hannity said very strongly to me and other people  hes willing to say it but nobody wants to call him i was against the war he said you used to have fights with me because sean was in favor of the warand i understand that side also not very much because we should have never been there but nobody called sean hannity and then they did an article in a major magazine shortly after the war started i think in 04 but they did an article which had me totally against the war in iraqand one of your compatriots said you know whether it was before or right after trump was definitely  because if you read this article theres no doubt but if somebody  and ill ask the press  if somebody would call up sean hannity this was before the war started he and i used to have arguments about the war i said its a terrible and a stupid thing its going to destabilize the middle east and thats exactly what its done its been a disaster no no you didnt hear what i said well i have much better judgment than she does theres no question about that i also have a much better temperament than she has you knowi have a much better  she spent  let me tell you  she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising  you know they get madison avenue into a room they put names  oh temperament lets go after  i think my strongest asset maybe by far is my temperament i have a winning temperament i know how to win she does not have a wait the aflcio the other day behind the blue screen i dont know who you were talking to secretary clinton but you were totally out of control i said theres a person with a temperament thats got a problem that would not start a war no they were taunting us wrong its lies that lines getting a little bit old i must say i would like to its not an accurate one at all its not an accurate one so i just want to give a lot of things  and just to respond i agree with her on one thing the single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament nuclear weapons not global warming like you think and your  your president thinksnuclear is the single greatest threat just to go down the list we defend japan we defend germany we defend south korea we defend saudi arabia we defend countries they do not pay us but they should be paying us because we are providing tremendous service and were losing a fortune thats why were losing  were losing  we lose on everything i say who makes these  we lose on everything all i said that its very possible that if they dont pay a fair share because this isnt 40 years ago where we could do what were doing we cant defend japan a behemoth selling us cars by the million well wait but its very important all i said was they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out were a country that owes 20 trillion they have to help us out as far as the nuclear is concerned i agree it is the single greatest threat that this country has well i have to say that you know for what secretary clinton was saying about nuclear with russia shes very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries but russia has been expanding their  they have a much newer capability than we do we have not been updating from the new standpointi looked the other night i was seeing b52s theyre old enough that your father your grandfather could be flying them we are not  we are not keeping up with other countries i would like everybody to end it just get rid of it but i would certainly not do first strikei think that once the nuclear alternative happens its over at the same time we have to be prepared i cant take anything off the table because you look at some of these countries you look at north korea were doing nothing there china should solve that problem for us china should go into north korea china is totally powerful as it relates to north koreaand by the way another one powerful is the worst deal i think ive ever seen negotiated that you started is the iran deal iran is one of their biggest trading partners iran has power over north koreaand when they made that horrible deal with iran they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to north korea and they should have done something with respect to yemen and all these other placesand when asked to secretary kerry why didnt you do that why didnt you add other things into the deal one of the great giveaways of all time of all time including 400 million in cash nobodys ever seen that before that turned out to be wrong it was actually 17 billion in cash obviously i guess for the hostages it certainly looks that wayso you say to yourself why didnt they make the right deal this is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history the deal with iran will lead to nuclear problems all they have to do is sit back 10 years and they dont have to do much and theyre going to end up getting nuclear i met with bibi netanyahu the other day believe me hes not a happy camper lester one thing id like to say i will go very quickly but i will tell you that hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat isis which she could have defeated by never having it you know get going in the first place right now its getting tougher and tougher to defeat them because theyre in more and more places more and more states more and more nations and its a big problem and as far as japan is concerned i want to help all of our allies but we are losing billions and billions of dollars we cannot be the policemen of the world we cannot protect countries all over the world  where theyre not paying us what we need and she doesnt say that because shes got no business ability we need heart we need a lot of things but you have to have some basic ability and sadly she doesnt have that all of the things that shes talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years lets say while she had great power but they werent taken care of and if she ever wins this race they wont be taken care of she doesnt have the look she doesnt have the stamina i said she doesnt have the stamina and i dont believe she does have the stamina to be president of this country you need tremendous stamina you have  wait a minute wait a minute lester you asked me a question did you ask me a questionyou have to be able to negotiate our trade deals you have to be able to negotiate thats right with japan with saudi arabia i mean can you imagine were defending saudi arabia and with all of the money they have were defending them and theyre not paying all you have to do is speak to them wait you have so many different things you have to be able to do and i dont believe that hillary has the stamina the world  let me tell you let me tell you hillary has experience but its bad experience we have made so many bad deals during the last  so shes got experience that i agreebut its bad bad experience whether its the iran deal that youre so in love with where we gave them 150 billion back whether its the iran deal whether its anything you can  name  you almost cant name a good deal i agree shes got experience but its bad experience and this country cant afford to have another four years of that kind of experience i never said that i didnt say that where did you find this where did you find this where did you find this oh really  ok good let me just tell you you know hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials some of its said in entertainment some of its said  somebody whos been very vicious to me rosie odonnell i said very tough things to her and i think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for herbut you want to know the truth i was going to say something  extremely rough to hillary to her family and i said to myself i cant do it i just cant do it its inappropriate its not nice but she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me many of which are absolutely untrue theyre untrue and theyre misrepresentationsand i will tell you this lester its not nice and i dont deserve thatbut its certainly not a nice thing that shes done its hundreds of millions of ads and the only gratifying thing is i saw the polls come in today and with all of that money  200 million is spent and im either winning or tied and ive spent practically nothing i want to make america great again we are a nation that is seriously troubled were losing our jobs people are pouring into our countrythe other day we were deporting 800 people and perhaps they passed the wrong button they pressed the wrong button or perhaps worse than that it was corruption but these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens ended up becoming citizens and it was 800 and now it turns out it might be 1800 and they dont even know look heres the story i want to make america great again im going to be able to do it i dont believe hillary will the answer is if she wins i will absolutely support her
