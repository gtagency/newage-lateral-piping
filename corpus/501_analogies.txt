Welcome to 501 Word Analogy Questions!
This book is
designed to help you prepare for the verbal and reasoning sections of
many assessment and entrance exams. By completing the exercises in
this book, you will develop the skills necessary to tackle each type of
analogy question.
Many standardized tests—including high school entrance exams,
the  SATs,  civil  service  exams,  the  GREs,  and  others—use  analogy
questions to test both logic and reasoning skills and word knowledge.
These questions ask test takers to identify relationships between pairs
of words. In order to solve analogy questions, you must first have a
clear  understanding  of  the  words’  definitions  and  then  use  that
understanding to determine how the words are related.
Analogy questions are often described as “blank is to blank as blank
is to blank.” So for example, puppy : dog :: kitten : ______, is read
“puppy is to dog as kitten is to blank.” The answer is, of course, “cat.”
However, the “blank is to blank” format does not really answer the
question  precisely.  More  accurately,  you  might  describe  the  rela-
tionship  between  puppy  and  dog  as  “a  puppy  is  a  young  dog.”  To
Introduction
determine the missing word, you might say “a kitten is a young . . . ”
The key to solving an analogy question is to precisely describe the
relationship between the pair of words and then apply the same rela-
tionship to determine which word completes the analogy.
Most analogy questions rely on your ability to deduce the correct
relationship between words and to draw logical conclusions about the
possible answer choices. For example in the question “Sherpa : Tibet
:: Massai : ______,” you can probably guess the correct answer from
the following choices—
a.
mountain, 
b.
bicycle, 
c.
Kenya, 
d.
desert—
even if you do not know the exact meaning of the words in the ques-
tion. The correct answer is Kenya—Sherpa are people who live in
Tibet  and  Massai  are  people  who  live  in  Kenya.  Even  if  you  were
unable to describe the relationship between the words because they
are unfamiliar, you could probably see that Kenya is the only coun-
try offered as a choice. As you know that Tibet , a country, is the sec-
ond half of the first pair, you can deduce that a country is necessary
to complete the second pair.
The relationships that are found in analogy questions fall into sev-
eral general types.
■
Part to Whole. In this type of question, a pair of words
consists of a part and a whole. For example, spoke :
wheel. A spoke is part of a wheel.
■
Type and Category. These questions use pairs of words in
which one word is a specific type in a general category.
For example, orange : citrus. An orange is a type of citrus.
■
Degree of Intensity. These questions test your ability to
discern nuance of meaning among pairs of words. For
example, shower : monsoon. A shower is light rainfall and
a monsoon is heavy rainfall.
■
Function. These questions pair words that are related
through function. For example, hammer : build. A
hammer is used to build.
■
Manner. This type of analogy describes the manner, way,
or style by which an action is accomplished. For example,
x
501
Word Analogy Questions
xi
shamble : walk. Shamble means to walk in an awkward
manner.
■
Symbol or representation. These questions pair words in
which one word is the symbol of the other. For example,
dove : peace. A dove is a symbol of peace.
■
Action and significance. In this type of analogy one word
describes an action and the other word indicates the
significance of the action. For example, cry : sorrow. To
cry signifies sorrow.
Analogy  questions  can  also  be  used  to  test  word  knowledge  and
factual content. Word knowledge questions are generally pairs of syn-
onyms or pairs of antonyms. For example, tardy : ______ :: liberal :
generous. Liberal and generous are synonyms, therefore you would
look for a synonym of tardy among the answer choices. Factual con-
tent questions demand a certain level of general knowledge, and can-
not be deduced from the relationship alone. For example:
iron : Fe :: silver : ______
a.
Na
b.
Cl
c.
Ag
d.
K
In this case you need to know that the chemical symbol for silver is
Ag. Even though these questions require some basic knowledge you
can still apply logic to the question. For example, if you know that the
chemical  name  for  table  salt  is  NaCl,  you  can  eliminate  these  two
answers. This leaves you with Ag and K. If you happen to know that
the French word for silver is 
argent
, then Ag would be an excellent
educated guess.
There is a final type of analogy question that is purely a logic test.
These questions pair seemingly unrelated words. The relationship is
found in the arrangement of the letters. For example:
501
Word Analogy Questions
xii
501
Word Analogy Questions
about : bout :: ______ : mend
a.
amend
b.
near
c.
tear
d.
dismiss
In this case, the answer is amend because that is the word formed by
adding an “a” in front of mend. You will also find scrambled words
and anagrams in this category of analogies.
The questions increase in difficulty as you move through each set
of exercises. Because this book is designed for many levels of test tak-
ers,  you  may  find  that  some  of  the  more  advanced  questions  are
beyond  your  ability.  If  you  are  using  this  book  to  study  for  a  high
school entrance exam, you may get a number of questions that appear
later in a section wrong. Don’t worry! If you are getting the earlier
questions  correct,  you  are  probably  in  good  shape  for  your  test.
However, if you are studying for a graduate-level exam such as the
GRE or the MAT, the full range of questions presented is appropri-
ate for your level.
The questions in this book can help you prepare for your test in
many ways. First, completing these practice exercises will make you
familiar with the question format. They will also help you get used
to identifying the relationships between pairs of words. In the case of
solving analogies, practice really does make perfect. The more com-
fortable you are with the question format and the more familiar you
are with the range of analogy types, the easier this section on your
test will become.
Second, your performance on these questions will help you assess
your ability and vocabulary level. You may find that you do very well
on those questions that require logical deduction to find the correct
answer, but that you have trouble with those questions that test word
knowledge. In this case, you will know that you need to spend more
time improving your vocabulary.
Third, you will become familiar not only with word relationships
and  word  meanings,  but  you  will  also  learn  to  spot  and  disregard
xiii
wrong answer choices through practice. At first, there may seem to
be  many  different  reasons  for  getting  various  questions  wrong.  At
closer look, however, there may be a pattern to your wrong answers.
Test preparers often spend as much time on wrong answer choices as
they do the right answer. For instance, let’s consider this analogy and
answer choices:
warm : hot :: ______ : hilarious
a.
humid
b.
raucous
c.
summer
d.
amusing
To  come  up  with  the  correct  answer,  you  must  first  figure  out  the
relationship. This is an analogy of degrees. Warm is less intense than
hot, therefore what answer choice is something that is less intense
than hilarious? The right answer is 
d
, based on the relationship of
amusing being less intense than hilarious. To illustrate how some test
takers get led astray by carefully crafted wrong answer choices, let’s
take a closer look at choices 
a
, 
b
, and 
c
. Some test takers will impul-
sively pick 
a
because humid is related to the first word pair, warm and
hot, but it is not part of the analogy of degree. This choice is offered
as an option for the careless reader. Other test takers will choose 
b
because they have misunderstood the analogy. They may think that
the word pair, warm : hot, is a synonym pair, showing faulty reason-
ing skills. Choosing 
c
is a slightly different case. Wrong answers may
also be chosen because of the test taker’s predisposition. In this exam-
ple, summer is chosen because warm : hot reminds the test taker of
summer. These are all illustrations of ways in which test takers can
get thrown off or distracted by wrong answer choices. Careful, close
reading, and lots of practice will help you to avoid the wrong answer
trap. And remember, as time runs out, you are more prone to make
careless  mistakes,  so  read  carefully  and  stay  calm.  Your  reasoning
skills and power of logic work better when you are not flustered, so
remain in control and stay alert.

Word Analogy Questions
Finally, let’s tackle the time issue. Most assessment tests are timed,
and time can be an important factor with analogy questions. Most
test takers have the necessary knowledge to answer the majority of
analogy questions, what many test takers don’t have is the ability to
answer the questions quickly. As you become more familiar with anal-
ogy questions, you will find that you can answer the questions more
quickly. You will be able to move through the basic questions with
confidence and allow yourself more time with the advanced questions
without feeling the pressure of the clock.
Each chapter contains between 35 and 50 questions, and the cor-
rect answers are explained at the end of each chapter. The answer sec-
tion  provides  you  with  not  only  the  right  answer,  but  also  the
relationship that is used to solve the analogy. Use your performance
to create a study guide. For example, examine your answers to deter-
mine if a particular type of analogy question is giving you trouble.
You may also find that your lack of word knowledge is causing you to
answer questions incorrectly. In this case you can spend time study-
ing word lists to improve your performance. If you are simply hav-
ing trouble with the more difficult questions, then more practice is
the answer. If you are looking for more challenging analogies, Chap-
ter 12 is made up of more difficult analogy questions. In addition, if
you  are  studying  for  the  Miller  Analogies  Test  (MAT),  don’t  miss
Chapter 13, which contains analogies that are great practice for this
unique test.
You have already taken an important step toward improving your
score. You have shown your commitment by purchasing this book.
Now all you need to do is complete each exercise, study the answers,
and watch your ability to solve analogies increase. You can even work
in  pencil  and  do  the  exercises  again  to  reinforce  what  you  have
learned. Good luck!
