are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of american works secretary clinton thank youmr trump the same question to you its about putting money  more money into the pockets of american workers you have up to two minutes secretary clinton would you like to respond let me follow up with mr trump if you can youve talked about creating 25 million jobs and youve promised to bring back millions of jobs for americans how are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas how specifically are you going to tell american manufacturers that you have to come back let me interrupt just a moment but back to the question though how do you bring back  specifically bring back jobs american manufacturers how do you make them bring the jobs back let me let secretary clinton get in here mr trump very quickly folks were going to were going to move to let me get you to pause right there because were going to move into  were going to move into the next segment were going to talk taxes please just take 30 seconds and then were going to go on well you just opened the next segment im going to give you a chance right here  with a new 15minute segment mr trump im going to the next segment were continuing  achieving prosperity ok you are unpacking a lot here and were still on the issue of achieving prosperity and i want to talk about taxes the fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthysecretary clinton youre calling for a tax increase on the wealthiest americans id like you to further defend that and mr trump youre calling for tax cuts for the wealthy id like you to defend that and this next twominute answer goes to you mr trump all right you have two minutes of the same question to defend tax increases on the wealthiest americans secretary clinton this is  this is secretary clintons two minutes please mr trump this is secretary clintons two minutes mr trump were mr trump were talking about the burden that americans have to pay yet you have not released your tax returns and the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to  who he owes it to and any business conflicts dont americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest the irs says an audit  of your taxes  youre perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit and so the question does the publics right to know outweigh your personal so its negotiable well ill let her answer that but let me just admonish the audience one more time there was an agreement we did ask you to be silent so it would be helpful for us secretary clinton he also  he also raised the issue of your emails do you want to respond to that mr trump well let you respond and well move on to the next segment lets let mr trump well were well behind schedule so i want to move to our next segment we move into our next segment talking about americas direction and lets start by talking about racethe share of americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest its been in decades much of it amplified by shootings of africanamericans by police as weve seen recently in charlotte and tulsa race has been a big issue in this campaign and one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gapso how do you heal the divide secretary clinton you get two minutes on this all right mr trump you have two minutes how do you heal the divide your two  your two minutes expired but i do want to follow up stopandfrisk was ruled unconstitutional in new york because it largely singled out black and hispanic young men the argument is that its a form of racial profiling secretary clinton secretary clinton secretary clinton last week you said weve got to do everything possible to improve policing to go right at implicit bias do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people mr trump please this conversation is about race and so mr trump i have to ask you for five please  20 seconds please respond then ive got a quick followup for you mr trump let me mr trump i mr trump for five years you perpetuated a false claim that the nations first black president was not a naturalborn citizen you questioned his legitimacy in the last couple of weeks you acknowledged what most americans have accepted for years the president was born in the united states can you tell us what took you so long that was i will let you respond its important but i just want to get the answer here the birth certificate was produced in 2011 youve continued to tell the story and question the presidents legitimacy in 2012 13 14 15  as recently as january so the question is what changed your mind im sorry im just going to follow up  and i will let you respond to that because theres a lot there but were talking about racial healing in this segment what do you say to americans people of color who secretary clinton mr trump you can respond and were going to move on to the next segment our next segment is called securing america we want to start with a 21st century war happening
